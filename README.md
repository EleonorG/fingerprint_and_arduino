Implements a nice interface to use the fingerprint scanner GT511C3 with an Arduino board.

# Main contributions
- grouping all three examples provided by sparkfun in one file, thus avoiding the necessary multiple uploads to interact with it. 
- adding the "Reset All" feature
- introducing a coherent communication code with the sensor LED.
